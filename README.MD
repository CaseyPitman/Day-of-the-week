IDENTIFY THE DAY OF THE WEEK A DATE FALLS ON

This app takes as input a date (month, day, year) and returns the day of the week that date fell on. 
It will also make an API fetch for a "This day in history" fact and display it along with the day of 
the week. 

On intialization the app will also retrieve the current date and set that as the placeholder text in the 
input field.
